<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players (or player in game with robot) who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three (or another size) grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three (this value depends of boards size) of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

I already have a similar project and you can find it in my repositories. It was only made almost a year ago and during this period my skills have grown a little, which means it's time to redo it using new technologies

Differences from the first version:
- Used Kotlin
- Custom View applied (in the first version, everything was quite static and was implemented using layout markup)
- There was at least some division of functionality into certain files, which together create a harmonious system (in the first version, everything was done in a stupid way - in one file)
- Now it is possible to set the size of the playing field (in the first version, the size was strictly specified (that is, logic) for the size of the field equal to 3x3)
- To the previously existing mode - playing with a friend, it became possible to play with a robot (in fact, it's just random🤪).
- The design has changed a lot
- Also, it became possible to track the account
